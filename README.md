Still Good Food
===============

What?
-----
This is a scraper for that site, written in go. The program will produce a JSON blob representing what I consider the important (pull requests welcome if you disagree) fields of a recipe to be from a URL that's a recipe. It exposes functions and types that you could use directly as a library if you don't want to convert back from a JSON blob/do your own IO.

Why?
----
Earlier this year an article implied that the [bbc good food website](http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/) would be taken down.
This turned out to be [false](https://twitter.com/bbcgoodfood/status/732504825930223616) but by the time I realised that I'd already written this, so here you are.
